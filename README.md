# Introduction
This repository contains most of my solutions to the problems in this interactive Python tutorial https://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/using-this-website/
I have ommitted some of the easier solutions and all of the scramble exercises. I completed all of these as a beginner and I wholeheartedly recommend working through this tutorial if you are just starting out in Python! I've included plenty of comments (too many) in my solutions. All of my solutions are numbered and should work if they are pasted directly into the answer box on the tutorial website, but please let me know if there are any issues. 

Good luck!
